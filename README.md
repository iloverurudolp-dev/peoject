Google Software Quality Management Research

1. Project Overview
This repository is the practical part of the final project for the course "Software Quality Management," using Google LLC as the research subject. Project content includes:
A. Analyzing Google's quality challenges
B. Defining ISO 25010 quality attributes
C. Identifying and tracking 8 software defects
D. Assessing CMMI maturity and proposing 3 improvements
E. Identifying 5 quality-related risks and developing mitigation plans
F. All defects, risks, and improvement items are recorded through GitHub Issues and tracked using a project Kanban board, achieving visualization and traceability of quality management.

2. Quality Policy
Google is committed to "making the world's information available to everyone." Based on this, the quality management of this project follows the following policy:
User safety first: All products and features must pass security reviews; risks such as data breaches and software defects must be controlled within acceptable limits.
Data-driven improvement: Establishing quantitative quality indicators (defect density, failure rate, test coverage) to guide decision-making with data.
Process Standardization: Mandate the use of pre-release checklists, code reviews, and automated testing to ensure consistent quality across teams.
Continuous Learning: Extract improvement measures from historical defects and risks to prevent similar problems from recurring.
